The challenge is to build the Easybank landing page and make it look as close as possible to the design provided in the Frontend Mentor challenge.

I am coding the landing page using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to complete the challenge. 

In JavaScript, I implemented a navigation bar toggle for mobile and tablet responsiveness. The navigation bar allows users to click and navigate to the Home, About, and Blog sections.
However, the Contact and Careers links currently redirect to the top section (Home section) because I haven't created separate pages for the Contact and Careers sections.

Finally, I would like to thank Frontend Mentor for providing this challenge. You can check out my coding and design work. Thank You for Watching! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
